This git repository contains my work during the summer of 2012. This includes code written in C++ to create a model consisting of a triangular network
of springs for networks of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton of cells. Additionally, there are several papers on the topic of modeling cell cytoskeletons and experiments
measuring the mechanical properties of cytoskeletons.
