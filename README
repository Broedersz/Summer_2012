This git repository contains my work during the summer of 2012. This
includes code written in C++ to create a model consisting of a triangular
network of springs for networks of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton
of cells. Additionally, there are several papers on the topic of modeling
cell cytoskeletons and experiments measuring the mechanical properties of
cytoskeletons.

The main file is located in program.cpp and is compiled by the following command:

    $ g++ -o program program.cpp
    
So, to run the program, run 

    $ ./program

For help, run

    $ ./program help

The help file will tell you the correct usage to set the parameters for the
simulation.
