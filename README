This git repository contains my work during the summer of 2012. This
includes code written in C++ to create a model consisting of a triangular
network of springs for networks of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton
of cells. Additionally, there are several papers on the topic of modeling
cell cytoskeletons and experiments measuring the mechanical properties of
cytoskeletons.

The main file is located in main.cpp and is compiled by the following command:

    $ g++ -g -o program main.cpp
    
So, to run the program, run 

    $ ./program

For help, run

    $ ./program help

The help file will tell you the correct usage to set the parameters for the
simulation. 

At the moment, the project compiles but is in the testing stage. Presently, the
program will calculate the energy of a network with a given strain as subject to
Lees-Edwards boundary conditions. I am currently implementing the gradient
function df in funcd.h to calculate the gradient for the entire system.

If you are not Chase Broedersz or me (Miles Yucht), I gladly offer you my code
and am open to suggestions, but I would appreciate it if you would not edit what
I have written so far without contacting me first (mgyucht@gmail.com).
